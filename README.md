**What is this website/repository?**
A GitHub repository is like a digital folder where developers store all the files and documents needed for their software projects. It also keeps a history of any changes made, so developers can track their work and collaborate with others easily.

**What is an "Issue"?**
In GitHub, an "Issue" is like a note or reminder where people can report problems and discuss the problems in detail, helping everyone involved keep track of what needs to be done.

**How to report an issue.**
To report an issue on GitHub, click on the "Issues" tab (at the top of this page), and then click "New Issue". Describe the problem you encountered in detail, providing steps to reproduce it if possible, and then submit it for the project team to review and address.

The more details you add, including screenshots and device information, the faster we can confirm the issue and start working on it.

**Where to discuss suggestions, ideas, etc.**
For discussing suggestions and ideas on GitHub, use the "Discussions" section of the repository. To do this, navigate to the "Discussions" tab in the repository, and click "New Discussion". Share your idea or suggestion clearly, providing as much detail as possible to help developers understand your concept. Use categories if theyâ€™re available, like "Ideas" or "Q&A", to keep discussions organized. This makes it easier for developers to engage and collaborate effectively with the community.

**How do I add my meetings to the C.A. App?**
